# IMDB Clone
## Built purly on Vanilla Javascript and Tailwind CSS
This project gives a basic understand on how API's work how we can use fetch(). I loved building this project because unlike using node or mongo the interaction between the elements was to be done with Javascript so this project helped me understand the DOM node structure very well regarding what elements are visible to other writing neat code because the project simply forces you to do so otherwise it all get's messy and difficult to debug. 
I had to make this project 3 times from the bottom just because my code got all jumbled and I was not able to debug I faced a lot of issues but finally a fully functional and working move db app is ready which you can for now use to search your movies and pin them to your favourites list. 
I will add more feature soon.

Thankyou Coding Ninjas for giving this wonderful and challenging project.
